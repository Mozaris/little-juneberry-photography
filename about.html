                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my photography page. I'm Allie, a proud mom of two adorable little girls, and wife to my amazing husband. We live a busy, fun-filled life with our two lovable dogs, and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sewing is one of my favorite hobbies—it helps me relax and get creative. I think that's why I'm so drawn to photography too—it's all about capturing those unique moments and stitching them together into stories we can cherish forever.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a photographer, I love working with families and individuals to create images that feel real, warm, and full of life. My goal is to provide you with timeless photos that you'll treasure for years to come.</p>
