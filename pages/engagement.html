                            <p>Engagement sessions are all about celebrating you as a couple. We'll work together to choose locations that are meaningful to you, whether that's where you first met, had your first date, or simply a beautiful outdoor setting that reflects your style.</p>
                            
                            <p>These sessions are relaxed and fun, giving you both a chance to get comfortable with me before your wedding day. It's also a perfect opportunity to practice being in front of the camera together!</p>
